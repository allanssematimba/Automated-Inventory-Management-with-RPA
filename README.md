# Automated-Inventory-Management-with-RPA

This project is an implementation of Inventory Management automation using RPA (Robotic Process Automation) in Python. The code uses the rpa module for RPA and PyPDF2 for PDF manipulation. The process involves opening an inventory management system website, adding new items to the inventory, updating existing items, and deleting items using PDF files stored in insert, update, and delete directories.

The automation uses visual automation to make the process feel almost similar to manual data entry, like opening PDF files and reading data. The script also takes screenshots of the updated table and saves it as a results.png file.
